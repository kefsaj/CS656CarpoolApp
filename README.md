Have you ever wondered if you could save money on gas and have thought about playing  your part in saving our planet? 

Well we have a solution to that problem. By introducing this application to the students at NJIT, we aim to play a part in reducing pollution, saving students on commute costs,  and reducing traffic on our roads. Our objective is to allow NJIT students to exchange information and schedule a carpool to/from NJIT. We hope to connect people through their smartphones to each other. In this document we will go through how we designed and implemented our idea.
	
As a small group with a lack of experience in mobile app development, we faced a plethora of issues. We started designing the application defining the objectives and how we should go forward. Focusing on Android application development, we faced problems as none of the team members knew kotlin and lack of experience in a new programming language created a blockage in progress. As some of the members knew python, we proceeded in researching python libraries such as Kivy and BeeWare. These were open-source tools that would convert a python script into Android apk file to be easily installed. Although Kivy was open sourced, it used proprietary user interaction elements such as labels buttons and elements of a UI toolkit which made it difficult for novice programmers to learn the whole library. The other option was BeeWare which used the native android toolkit  but support was lacking to jump right in and create a mobile application in a couple of weeks. 

This is a work in progress.
